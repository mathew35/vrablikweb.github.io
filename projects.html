                    <article class="Home_Server">
                        <h3>Reason:</h3>
                        <p>Truenas Scale HomeServer for photos,programing codes,etc. Maybe even video server, but this might not be possible with limited hardware of this machine.</p>
                        <h3>Problems:</h3>
                        <p>1. Unable to install directly from USB: At first, I tried install from USB on the machine itself. The very first problem arose with ACPI. My older hardware doesn't support ACPI so it had to be turned of in grub menu edit using
                            2 switches "noacpi" and "acpi=off". Next problem was RAM. 1.5GB wasn't nearly enough to install. My solution was VM which allowed me to finally install Truenas.</p>
                        <p>2. Low on RAM: After installing and setting up pool,datasheet(s) I wanted to access the files through app for easier upload and download as I wasn't the only one meant to use this server. Truenas catalog offered NextCloud for this
                            purpose. After installing the app I ended wandering why it wasn't deploying and online. Reason being low RAM... TIME FOR UPGRADE</p>
                        <h3>Upgrade:</h3>

                        <h3>Online server:</h3>
                        <p>Though I intended for the server to be online accesible, it is not possible due to few reasons.</p>
                        <b>1. Public IP: My provider is using NAT and therefore no public IP for me unless I buy one for monthly subscription</b>
                        <br>
                        <b>2. Internet speed: DSL ... That's for short. High price and low speeds.</b>
                        <p>As intended for personal use and one web about me and my projects, this doesn't compare to monthly price for this server. Therefore it stays offline and for home use only so far. As for my web it is here on github using github.io
                            feature.
